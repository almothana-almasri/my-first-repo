# my-notes

## Hello my name is **Almothana Almasri**

### I am an electrical power engineer who is studying to be a full-stack developer too.

## **What I've learned in today's lecture**

* How to connect a remote repo to a local machine
* How to update changes from local machine to the remote repo
* What is the difference between ***GUI*** and ***CLI*** and how to navigate through Linux using ***CLI***

## **The main points that I have learned from "Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes"**

1. Continuous learning: Technology is constantly changing, and as a developer, I need to stay on top of the latest trends and tools. A good developer mindset means being open to learning new things and continuously improving my skills.
2. Attention to detail: A good developer mindset means being attentive to detail, double-checking work, and being willing to spend extra time on testing and debugging to ensure that the end product is high quality.
3. And what I think that differs those who go far in programming to those who don't is to never give up and always keep trying.
